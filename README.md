# Project Overview

## Project Name

LiftLog

## Project Description

The idea of this website is to give the user the ability to keep track of their weightlifting workouts. At it's most basic it will act as a virtual notebook. The idea is that the user will be able to submit the following:
The "Day" the literal date and/or "Day" of a program they are following.
The lift: user-provided text input becuase everyone does things differently. Ex, "Bench Press".
Reps: How many reps of the exercise they are doing. Ex 5\*5 etc.
Notes: A text input for misc notes.
On the homepage the user can see the basics of their most recently created submissions such as Day and Lift, and the on click it will expand to show more detail.

General Notes on Plan:
1 - Set up Basics of the "Home Page" This includes the header, NavBar and the submission form.

2 - Get the submission form working. Since the content of the "Show page" is going to be user-generated the submission form must be functional.

3 - Get the show page working. This means that the data submitted on the home page should render on the show page.

4 - Get the lb to kg calculator page working.

5 - CSS styling. Basic styling will be done as I go, the overall styling will be done after the JS/React is done.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a strong sense for planning and the ability to get started on a project.

### Weaknesses:

I frequently hit walls when coding.

### Opportunities:

I have the opportunity to look back at lessons and exercises to help me get the project complete.

### Threats:

I'm not the strongest coder, so a threat is getting stuck and not knowing what to do.
