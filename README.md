# Project Overview

## Project Name

LiftLog

## Project Description

The idea of this website is to give the user the ability to keep track of their weightlifting workouts. At it's most basic it will act as a virtual notebook. The idea is that the user will be able to submit the following:
The "Day" the literal date and/or "Day" of a program they are following.
The lift: user-provided text input becuase everyone does things differently. Ex, "Bench Press".
Reps: How many reps of the exercise they are doing. Ex 5\*5 etc.
Notes: A text input for misc notes.
On the homepage the user can see the basics of their most recently created submissions such as Day and Lift, and the on click it will expand to show more detail.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:

I have a strong sense for planning and the ability to get started on a project.

### Weaknesses:

I get stuck a lot.

### Opportunities:

I have the opportunity to look back at lessons and exercises to help me get the project complete.

### Threats:

I'm not the strongest coder, so a threat is getting stuck and not knowing what to do.
